                SkinLine AI uses a deep machine learning algorithm
                (AI-algorithm). The human ability to learn from examples and
                experiences has been transferred to a computer. For this
                purpose, the neural network has been trained using a dermoscopic
                imaging database containing tens of thousands of examples that
                have confirmed diagnosis and assessment by dermatologists.

                The AI is able to distinguish between benign and malignant
                tumors, similar to the ABCDE rule (5 main signs of oncology:
                asymmetry, boundary, color, diameter, and change over time). The
                difference between them is that the algorithm can analyze
                thousands of features, but not only 5 of them. Of course, only a
                machine can detect that amount of evidence.

                Due to the productive cooperation with doctors, the quality of
                the algorithm performance is constantly being improved. Based on
                growing experience and its own autonomous rules, the AI is able
                to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, find risks
                of human papillomavirus, and classify different types of acneâ€¦
